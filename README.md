# project-2
This repository contains a deep learning project implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. Trained on CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The model achieves high accuracy in recognizing and categorizing images across multiple animal classes. Built using TensorFlow/Keras, with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization included.
